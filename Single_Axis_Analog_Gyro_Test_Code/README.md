[![Grove - Single Axis Analog Gyro](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/thumb/9/95/Axis_Analog_Gyro_01.jpg/400px-Axis_Analog_Gyro_01.jpg)](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-single-axis-analog-gyro-p-1451.html?cPath=144_146)


The Grove â€“ Signal Axis Analog Gyro is based on an angular velocity sensor that uses the phenomenon of Coriolis force. It can only measure the X-axis angular velocity, which is different from other 3-Axis gyro, but with a higher speed. It can be used for the position control and attitude control like the self-balanced 2WD.


### Usage:

Just open this ino file with Arduino IDE and play.

Assume that you connected the grove correctly.
