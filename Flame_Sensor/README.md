[![Grove Flame Sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/images/product/Flame%20Sensor.jpg)](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-flame-sensor-p-1450.html?cPath=144_222)

This is an Arduino example for [Grove Flame Sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-flame-sensor-p-1450.html?cPath=144_222)

The Grove - Flame Sensor can be used to detect fire source or other light sources of the wavelength in the range of 760nm - 1100 nm.
It is based on the YG1006 sensor which is a high speed and high sensitive NPN silicon phototransistor.
Due to its black epoxy, the sensor is sensitive to infrared radiation.
In fire fighting robot game, the sensor plays a very important role, it can be used as a robot eyes to find the fire source.

### Usage:

Just open this ino file with Arduino IDE and play.

Assume that you connected the grove correctly.
